        <h4>Chronic kidney disease</h4>
        <p>
          Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, describes
          the gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and
          excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine.
          When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous
          levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body.

        <h4>Malaria</h4>
        <p>
          Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and
          other animals. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever,
          tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases it can cause
          yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin ten to
          fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. If not
          properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months
          later.

        <h4>Pneumonia</h4>
        <p>
          Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both
          lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material),
          causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty
          breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and
          fungi, can cause pneumonia.
        </p>
        <h5>Symptoms</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
